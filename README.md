# Bellman-Ford-and-Floyd-Warshall-Algorithms
This is an implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. These algorithms find the shortest paths in a graph and print the time it took for the algorithm to execute. This assignment was for my CS 141 (Intermediate Data Structures and Algorithms) course.

To run this program: 
Go to the directory where this file is located. Then type in the following command "python Shortestdistance_graph_algos.py input.txt". The input.txt file contains the nodes that are fed into the program.
